# FacialRegonitionChatClient
This is a project I worked on with @thoughton3. We implemented a chat client which requires a facial scan to use. This project contains modified code from Adriain Rosebrock's blog https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/02/26/face-detection-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/. Download and launch Chat.sh to use.
